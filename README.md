# YouTube Title to YouTube View Prediction Model

This project is focused on predicting the number of views a YouTube video might get based on its title. The model uses various techniques, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and data analysis, to extract features from video titles and make predictions about their potential view count.


## Features

- **YouTube Title Analysis**: The model processes the title of a YouTube video to predict its number of views.
- **Prediction Model**: Machine learning algorithms primariry linear regression to predict views based on title-related features.
- **Text Processing**: Uses NLP techniques to clean, tokenize, and extract meaningful features from video titles.
- **Dataset**: The model uses a large dataset of YouTube video titles using Youtube DataAnalytics API and their respective views to train and make accurate predictions.
- **Prediction Output**: Provides the predicted number of views based on input title and associated features.
